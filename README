===================
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
-- suitable C++ compiler (preferably gcc >= 3.4)
-- make

This code has been tested using gcc 3.4.2 on Solaris 5.8 (sparc), and
gcc 4.1.2 on GNU Linux 2.6.18 (x86), but should compile fine with any
standard C++ compiler.

===========
COMPILATION
===========
A makefile has been included with this distribution, so to compile the code
it suffices to run the make command.
All the source code is located in the src/ directory, and there is one
test case included so far in the tests/ directory.

=====
USAGE
=====
./maxflow [FILE]

The FILE parameter is optional; if unspecified, it will default to
"challenge.net". Otherwise, it will read the input network from FILE.
The format of the file must be in the DIMACS format, and must be
syntactically correct (otherwise the behaviour is undefined). The
DIMACS format is described in the source code, as well as at the following
webpage: http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/DIMACS_maxf.htm

The value of the maximum flow is displayed upon termination of this program.

=========
ALGORITHM
=========
The algorithm used is the highest-level variant of the preflow-push algorithm,
with several heuristics:
- local relabeling heuristic
- gap heuristic
- global relabeling heuristic (actually this is only done twice)
- 2-phase approach
